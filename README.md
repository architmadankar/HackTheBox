## Introduction
This repository serves as a collection of my notes and Proof of Concept (PoC) documentation for various vulnerable machines from Hack The Box. These notes are part of my ongoing learning process and hobby in penetration testing and cybersecurity.

## Notes Structure
Each machine has its own directory, which contains the following:
- **Enumeration**: Steps and tools used for initial enumeration.
- **Exploitation**: Detailed steps for exploiting the machine.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Steps taken after gaining access, including privilege escalation.
- **Conclusion**: Summary and lessons learned from the machine.

## Usage
Feel free to browse through the directories and notes to learn about different exploitation techniques and methodologies. These notes are meant for educational purposes and to enhance your understanding of penetration testing.

## Contributing
If you have any suggestions, improvements, or additional notes that you would like to share, please feel free to create a pull request. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
