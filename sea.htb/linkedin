🚀 **HackTheBox Seasonal: Sea 🌊**

Just wrapped up an exciting HackTheBox challenge, tackling the **Sea.HTB** machine! This was an awesome journey, from recon to privilege escalation, and I’m excited to share the highlights:

🔍 **Reconnaissance:**
- Used **Rustscan** to identify open ports—SSH and HTTP were exposed.
- **WhatWeb** revealed that the site runs on PHP and uses cookies for session management.
- Employed **FFUF** to perform directory enumeration, discovering some crucial files in the `/themes/bike/` directory.

💡 **Exploitation:**
- Found an exploit for **WonderCMS (CVE-2023-41425)** and successfully executed it to gain a reverse shell. 
- Explored the server with **Linpeas** and discovered a bcrypt hash in the `database.js` file, which I cracked using **Hashcat** to obtain credentials.

🔑 **Privilege Escalation:**
- Gained SSH access as user `amay` and discovered a web server running on port 8080.
- Created an SSH tunnel to explore the web server, where I found a System Monitor page that allowed me to read log files.
- Finally, used a custom payload to escalate privileges and capture the root flag! 🏴

This challenge was a great opportunity to sharpen my skills in reconnaissance, web exploitation, and privilege escalation. Every step was a learning experience, and I’m looking forward to tackling more challenges like this!
