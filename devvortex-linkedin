Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my recent journey on a box named DevVortex by Hack The Box, where I managed to escalate privileges from a Joomla web application to root access on the machine. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

Title: Journey from Joomla to Root: Exploiting CVEs and Privilege Escalation

### Enumeration and Joomla Exploitation

1. **Nmap Scan:**
 - Identified open ports: 23, 25, 53, 80.
 - Joomla version: 4.2.6.

2. **Joomla Vulnerability Check:**
 - Confirmed Joomla core was not vulnerable.

3. **Admin Page Discovery:**
 - Found the admin page at http://dev.devvortex.htb/administrator/.

4. **Exploitation:**
 - Utilized an existing exploit (https://lnkd.in/ggmuNaF7) for CVE-2023-23752.
 - Retrieved Joomla database credentials: lewis/P4nth-------c0n##.

### Database Exploration

1. **MySQL Access:**
 - Accessed the MySQL database using credentials.
 - Found user information in `sd4fg_users` table.

2. **Cracking Password Hash:**
 - Cracked the hashed password: `tequieromucho`.

### SSH Access

1. **SSH Login:**
 - Logged in as user `logan` with the cracked password.

2. **User Flag:**
 - Located and retrieved the user flag: `bdbcade-----------2328d`.

### Privilege Escalation

1. **Sudo Privileges:**
 - Checked sudo privileges using `sudo -l`.
 - Discovered that user `logan` could run `/usr/bin/apport-cli` as any user.

2. **Exploiting CVE-2023-1326 (Apport):**
 - Found an exploit for CVE-2023-1326: https://lnkd.in/gwqYW9AB.
 - Executed the exploit to gain root access.

### Root Access

1. **Root Flag:**
 - Accessed the root directory and retrieved the root flag: `1a9377e-----------6f9293e`.
